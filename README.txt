QuickChat Final Maven Project

This project implements:
- Part 1: Console-based Registration & Login (Scanner).
- Part 2 & 3: JOptionPane GUI dialogs (Option C style: separate dialog per step).
- Users must register first; no fixed credentials are provided.
- JUnit tests for message logic are included (they don't open GUI).

To run in NetBeans:
1. Open as a Maven project.
2. Run the Main class (console will prompt Register or Login).
3. After successful login, the GUI will start.
